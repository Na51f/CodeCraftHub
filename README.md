This was my final project for my Generative AI for Software Developers from IBM. Not everything works. Purely because we were tasked to create the entire thing using ChatGPT 4o-mini. So naturally due to 4o-mini's limits, AI hallucinations prevent this app from working.

Now that I have completed the course. I will return to fix up this repository in the future.
